        <h1>What is this</h1>
        <p>This project provides you with a cli tool that you can use to generate source code files in your project, You will have a file named atomicg.yml in the root of your project, in this file you can put the entities you want to generate for your project, you also can specify what generators must be use. You can run the tool from the command line to generate the source code files that match your configuration. You can repeat this process indefinetly to always have a funtional well formated and well writen model of data for your project.</p>

        <h1>How it Works</h1>
        <p>The tool works with our remote server to create the source code files for your project, First, the cli client tool collects the information from your local file system, namedly it will read and upload your model and send it to the server. Then the server will process your model and generated the relevant source code files. Finally the server will send the generated source code files to the cli tool so it can put the files in your projects in their respective locations.</p>
